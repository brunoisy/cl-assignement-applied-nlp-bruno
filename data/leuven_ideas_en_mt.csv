b71b04b3-7347-4e49-9e67-3242df88fb1a,Bringing people together the knock knock way,"The lifestyle of people is changing overtime. The distance
between houses is getting closer due to the increase in city
saturation. In Belgium more people are living in apartments than
in houses, but neighbors are interacting less and less. It is
noticed that neighbor’s relations are minimal or even absent. It
is found that 35% of neighbors do not even know the name of their
neighbors. This behavior is a result of several factors. It could
be considered surprising that 89% of neighbors would love to
establish good relationships with their neighbors.

Other behaviors are noticed with most Europeans while living in
economic hard times. Many Belgians began, back in 2008, to look
at second-hand alternatives when making purchases. Thus, began
the second-hand boom in Belgium, where 84% of Belgians bought
second-hand products. With the economic factors in their favor,
many second-hand stores flourished.

It could be suggested that relationships between neighbors can
create a better society. Improving the consumption power by
removing borders and decreasing distances between neighbors could
kill two birds with one stone. 78% of Belgian citizens have items
at home which they rarely use or maybe do not use anymore for a
reason or another. These items can be very useful for others.
Many neighbors are open and willing to loan items to their
neighbors for free. A small fee can even motivate neighbors to
depreciate the cost of these items faster and therefore increase
their purchase power. Borrowing items from your neighbors can
also enhance sustainability by using less raw materials and
lowering CO2 emission.

Neighbors might need the help of each other. However, without
knowing each other they do not know who to ask. They would not
know if there are some neighbors who are willing to help others
and they do not know who needs help. Still, 43% of people have no
courage to knock on other neighbors to ask for help or to borrow
something. Everyone has some known or hidden skills and
expertise. Generally, when a neighbor needs a service he/she will
look and consult a company/association. In the cases where the
needed service is available, the service can be very costly.
Whereas, there might be a neighbor who can provide the service
for a symbolic price or for free. In this way, neighbors can bond
with each other and feel useful. Socially, when neighbors help
each other, it makes everyone in the neighborhood feel at home
and consequently, the neighborhood becomes more pleasurable.
Economically, this can make the life of neighbors more affordable
by preventing them from spending money on services their neighbor
could provide for free.

A platform which can connect people and stimulate social contact
between citizens with the purpose of helping and supporting each
other, could be a good solution to make their life more
enjoyable.",Buddy Hammes III,6/9/2019,3,0,"Cleanliness and waste,Sustainable development"

8609d66f-fb95-4b30-b2a0-5a36a5d09fc1,Dangerous points for cyclists:,"Time and time again at Leuven station, both cyclists and pedestrians have to take risks to get past and to the bus stops. What is wrong with traffic lights and crosswalks in such a busy place? At least with traffic lights you know that it is a lot safer to get to and from or past the bus and train station. Buses no longer stop to let cyclists pass when they enter / leave their parking space! The same applies to the intersection at the station and the KBC office. How can all those cycling students, working people in full rush hour, get here safely to the bicycle depot ?! Dangerous & unclear situations !!! Can't this junction be built more bicycle friendly! The beautiful bike path from the Tiensepoort along the ring that suddenly stops when you arrive at the KBC office & station, that makes no sense ??? Now we have a bicycle parking at the station but you can only drive there safely from one side ... along the outer ring, but to drive from the center (Bondgenotenlaan) towards bicycle parking, there is no and certainly no safe way ... and skews everyone at risk of pedestrians, bicycles, buses and oncoming traffic. To the Mr. Van Waeyenberghlaan, where many students, employees and visitors, who drive back to the city from the hospital site Gasthuisberg every day, does have a cycle path, but with many unevenness and a dangerous end to the cycle path. Can this part of the cycle path be tackled? On the Herestraat, around Gasthuisberg, no one adheres to the speed limit of 30 km / hour !!! Either this is unclear and / or no checks are carried out. For the many cyclists, pedestrians who have to cross the street in different places here, it remains a dangerous situation if motorists do not keep to the speed. From the Brusselsestraat (shopping area) towards Amerikalei it is unclear where cyclists have to cross here. On foot across the crosswalk? If Leuven is to become more bicycle-friendly, this is certainly an issue that must also be addressed ... because it does not make sense as a cyclist that you should get off here. Also at the end of the Capuchin food near the slaughterhouse site it is unclear where the cyclists have to drive towards the ring ... on the street between the cars or on the footpath on the side of the slaughterhouse site?

443c00cf-8a37-4735-8ca9-222dcfe2847f,fewer buses in Fonteinstraat,"Bus streets in the city center: Since the circulation plan is in effect, the Fonteinstraat and Tessenstraat in Leuven have unfortunately turned into real BUS STREETS! One bus after another squeezes between parked cars and the footpath from morning to night. Cyclists take refuge on the footpath. Is it really necessary that there are so many buses, one after the other, thundering through a crowded residential area. Can you check how many buses pass through here every day because I have lost count !!! Due to the changes that start on May 27 in Fonteinstraat and Tessenstraat, the number of buses will increase and their speed will increase even more, because there will be no obstacles anymore !!! Does this mean that this will be a definitive bus route ???? And this in such a crowded residential street! Where can we still cycle safely in our street? Where are the plans for ring buses and tram? Can 'systematic' more be checked for noise nuisance, exhaust gases / CO2 (curio choices) AND the speed of cars AND buses. And I mean control in those streets where ALL traffic has to go through since the circulation plan. 30 km / h in the city center remains 'wishful thinking'. In my opinion, there are few drivers who stick to the 30 km / h! Could the cut on the Capucijnenvoer be more clearly indicated ... because many ordinary cars that come from the ring to the center still drive straight on here to Brusselsestraat & Fonteinstraat and therefore also cause danger and extra traffic. The traffic sign that you are no longer allowed to drive through at the St. Raphaël hospital is really too small and not noticeable enough! At the intersection of Tessenstraat with Brusselsestraat it is unclear who has priority here, so it is often very dangerous to get out of Tessenstraat here, because hardly anyone, cars or cyclists, who come from the center, give priority here! There are also still cars coming from Tessenstraat that do not see / ignore the one-way sign and drive to the left towards the center. Can the traffic signs be placed more clearly? More speed controls and LESS and SMALLER ELECTRIC buses in the city center, including Fonteinstraat / Tessenstraat, could make the district a bit more livable. Many of the buses that run through the city center can certainly be replaced by ring buses. Due to the circulation plan, traffic is concentrated to a few streets, making the nuisance of urban traffic and CO2 extra large here. When the construction of the Hertogen site was announced, there was always talk about a tram that would run through the Hertogensite, are these plans still there? A tram through the Hertogensite could certainly take away some traffic from the Fonteinstraat and Tessenstraat. Perhaps the circulation plan should (once again) be objectively evaluated ... In the Brouwerstraat near house number 48/50 there is one parking lot that drives in and out to the parking lot (+/- 30 parking spaces) of building no. 50 seriously complicated. Can't this one parking lot be moved to the other side of the Brouwerstraat? That would save a lot of maneuvering! There is already a cut on the Tessenstraat in the Brouwerstraat, which has already seriously reduced the excess traffic nuisance. Dangerous points for cyclists: At Leuven station it is time and again for everyone ... both cyclists and pedestrians have to take risks to get past and to the bus stops. What is wrong with traffic lights and crosswalks in such a busy place? At least with traffic lights you know that it is a lot safer to get to and from or past the bus and train station. Buses no longer stop to let cyclists pass when they enter / leave their parking space! The same applies to the intersection at the station and the KBC office. How can all those cycling students, working people in full rush hour, get here safely to the bicycle depot ?! Dangerous & unclear situations !!! Can't this junction be built more bicycle friendly! The beautiful bike path from the Tiensepoort along the ring that suddenly stops when you arrive at the KBC office & station, that makes no sense ??? Now we have a bicycle parking at the station but you can only drive there safely from one side ... along the outer ring, but to drive from the center (Bondgenotenlaan) towards bicycle parking, there is no and certainly no safe way ... and skews everyone at risk of pedestrians, bicycles, buses and oncoming traffic. To the Mr. Van Waeyenberghlaan, where many students, employees and visitors, who drive back to the city from the hospital site Gasthuisberg every day, does have a cycle path, but with many unevenness and a dangerous end to the cycle path. Can this part of the cycle path be tackled? On the Herestraat, around Gasthuisberg, no one adheres to the speed limit of 30 km / hour !!! Either this is unclear and / or no checks are carried out. For the many cyclists, pedestrians who have to cross the street in different places here, it remains a dangerous situation if motorists do not keep to the speed. From the Brusselsestraat (shopping area) towards Amerikalei it is unclear where cyclists have to cross here. On foot across the crosswalk? If Leuven is to become more bicycle-friendly, this is certainly an issue that must also be addressed ... because it does not make sense as a cyclist that you should get off here. Also at the end of the Capuchin food near the slaughterhouse site it is unclear where the cyclists have to drive towards the ring ... on the street between the cars or on the footpath on the side of the slaughterhouse site? Is this a bike path or just a footpath? If you come from the Prosper Poulletlaan, it is very dangerous to drive onto the Capuchin food because you do not see any traffic coming from the ring. Can a mirror be placed here so that you can see the traffic coming? A mirror would make it a lot safer to drive up the Capuchin food! When will the renovation of the boundary wall in the Handbogenhof start? This is a gem in the downtown area, and it has been talked about renovating this piece of the old ring wall for 25 years, but nothing is being done about it other than supporting the wall! Isn't it high time that this is finally addressed before it completely falls over! Hopefully you will find a good solution for these improvement proposals.",Wayne Dooley MD,5/26/2019,3,1,

Due to the numerous negative reactions, this idea was ""parked"" again. We were not in favor of it ourselves, but we do see another potential solution: the marking of kiss-and-ride strips where short-term parking is permitted. In this way, residents of small homes have the opportunity to stop for a moment near their house, unload the groceries, let children safely in and out of the car, etc. No more temporary space for neighbors' garages. , the quick-sorry-car-behind-me-but-my-baby-is-sleeping-with-four-winkers-now-finally-standing-on-the-road and a nice spot for the ice cream cart when she comes by.

Provide lighting and a good infrastructure on these routes so that they are safe in all areas. The idea is that you can go from your home to the bakery or school, without coming into contact with dangerous and polluting motorized traffic. Such routes should tempt you to go by bicycle instead of by car. Simply because it is safer, more pleasant, healthier and faster! These routes ensure that your children can safely cycle to school themselves. A beautiful example of this is the Jan Vranckxweg in Kessel-Lo (photo). By connecting all green spaces, you not only create opportunities for the soft road users, but you also counteract the fragmentation of our green space and we give more opportunities to biodiversity. For all of Leuven, it would be possible to consider where all this would be possible and which functional places (sports hall, town hall, swimming pool, bakery, nurseries, schools, ...) can thus all be linked together.

The alternative is the Wilselsesteenweg, which is too narrow for the parked cars, the two-way traffic and the buses. So you would rather not cycle there. I see 3 solutions: * Talk to the province about more well-marked cycle paths / routes through the provincial domain. Now cycling is limited there. * allow cyclists to cycle through the football field of Bruineveld. Now the door is sometimes open and you can continue cycling, but it is always a gamble because there is no indication whether the door on the other side is open.

I pass here by bike several times a day and always find the following: usually there is a car on the corner less than a meter from the intersection so that as a cyclist (coming out of the steep alley) you cannot see at all a car arrives and cars never slow down (and this is no exaggeration) for the right-of-way. In concrete terms, it is therefore a very unsafe situation as a cyclist from Heverlee station to take this alley down and turn left (this is the forbidden direction for cars but allowed for cyclists). My concrete proposal: more control on the parking errors on that street corner, a mirror so that, as a cyclist and as a car, you can see whether someone is coming from the Alley and preferably also a road sign with something in the nature of 'careful right-of-way' or ' pay attention to cyclists' priority.",Marg Satterfield,6/9/2019,2,0,"Streets and squares,Mobility"

Crossroads Kerspelstr and Hertogstr: more than 20cm -The field code prescribes how far planting must be kept away from the neighbors, for example a tree must remain 2m from the separation. In the Kapellenlaan and other places, the city planted rows of trees at 0.5m. -The ""built-up area"" plates were planted on the municipal boundary, to limit the speed to 50Kmh and not because the bowl starts there. This is deliberate abuse. -Where the road code ""cannot"" be applied, other measures must be taken. From May 1 there should be 1.5m space for cyclists.

In a digital world in which we are connected 24/7 via technology, we need active, conscious, creative and critical citizens and a sense of community. Together with engaged citizens (coderdojos), preschool initiatives, nursery, primary, secondary and higher education, we can outline a trajectory, a continuous learning path in which everyone who grows up in Leuven, attends school from an early age, learns how technology works, how the physical world interacts with the digital. I don't know if it is realistic, but dreams are allowed and the 'One Laptop per Child' project is an inspiring example of how we can give children (and adults) their own technology. More concretely, I dream that every Leuven child / young person will get building blocks to expand their technological medium in order to discover technology from scratch, together with peers, teachers, educators, parents, at school, in the neighborhood. Rather than the technological 'black boxes' they are now presented with from childhood. They grow up with insight into how (digital) technology works and we prepare them for current and future challenges for people and society. Linked to this we can use them as eg. Take the Gluon STARTS Academy of Link in de Kabel initiatives on a journey of discovery into how (digital) technology can be used and developed with an eye for people and society. Leuven seems to be the ideal place with IMEC, Mindgate, MaakLeerPlek (from Everyone Master to Everyone Maker), and the KULeuven to achieve this within the broad community. I suspect that there are already many initiatives that focus on this, but they are fragmented. It would be good to connect these together and together write an ambitious continuous learning track for everyone. To realize the vision, there is a need for experiments, exchanging dreams and concrete projects and cooperation. Maybe we can start with some cases in the coming months.

Wilsele-Putkapel is a beautiful village that has everything to be a green sub-municipality where proximity and social cohesion are optimal. However, there is one major drawback to our municipality. Many facades and front gardens are desolate. The reconstruction of our central axis several years ago has not helped much. Better cycle paths and good road surfaces are certainly positive. But after a few years, the few planted trees have still not grown much. This connection that cuts our village in two often has a somewhat desolate and gray impression. In other words, the AarschotseSTEENweg has not stolen its name. This contrasts sharply with the streets and gardens behind it, where beautiful islands of private and public greenery can often be found. Just think of the greenest primary school in the world, Karel Hertog. The alternative? More green!

An example of this is the Richard Valvekensstraat in Kessel-Lo: many cyclists coming from the back of the station continue on the Locomotievenstraat (which is already low-traffic) through the Richard Valvekensstraat and Désiré Mellaertsstraat. In these narrow streets, however, there is also busy car traffic in both directions, including a lot of short-cut traffic to and from the Diestsesteenweg.

0651ef30-8099-477b-9c94-0e344d9f6d4d,"Dear Mayor, aldermen!","With your appeal to the people of Leuven to give -yes or not good- ideas, I want to put down some of my thoughts with your approval. 1.LEUVEN KLIMA NEUTRAL !!!! / ??? Leuven, our beautiful city deserves to get even better. It was suggested to interrupt the Burchtstraat. I don't know why this decision. In any case, this measure will NOT come to make Leuven Climbing Neutral in the future !!! If we only look at the accessibility of two department stores - to do the daily shopping in Lidl and Colruyt - we can conclude that for every move from Wilsele village and surroundings, tens of car kilometers means more. The inhabitants of the blocks around the Vaartkom and Engelsplein also have to travel considerably longer to reach the motorway and to get to work. Not to mention the loss of time due to the congestion around and around the Artois square. I hope that our elect will not want to rule against their own citizens, but keep their well-being in mind. 2. ""our"" school children, LET THEM SAFE AND LONGER LIFE !!!!! Nowadays the rule is that cyclists must wear a helmet and clothing that make them visible in traffic. My suggestion: have the children wear a fluorescent strap on their left arm and teach them the following: look around when crossing and then straighten their left arm (this will make them more visible to the mobilized traffic) and then start the crossing. This is for pedestrians. Have the cycling children wear a strap on both arms and teach them to use their hands if they want to change direction; also teach them to become aware of their weak position. Have them use the bell when approaching a pedestrian to avoid accidents, as a pedestrian cannot hear them approaching. 3. animals on public property. SOCIAL BEHAVIOR OF PEOPLE !!!! Almost every day I see in the public area, greenery, footpath, children's playground dog shit. When I am outdoors with my dog, I always have bags to use in an emergency. As a keeper of an animal, one is responsible and must take other people into account. In Wenduine I saw a very practical holder, where one could deposit the bag with the dog poo. There in the Astrid Park I saw no dirt on the ground and everything was clean. Of course, what organization requires the holders to empty regularly. Take note for our beautiful Leuven. 4. Order and tidiness on the street (DIRT looking for DIRT !!!!) I regularly see abandoned bags, packs and remains of construction work on the street. Depositing bags with garbage in the public area should be fined more severely if the perpetrator is found. Put differently with material of all kinds left behind by employees of entrepreneurs who carry out work on behalf of Leuven. We have walking city guards who - with their eyes open - could report such abuses and then take the appropriate action. After the work has been carried out, checks will be made by the relevant city service before the contractor is reimbursed ???? If YES, how come all temporary road signs along the street without any activity in the area ??? I also regularly find that bags of household garbage are left out days before collection by the cleaning service and fall prey to birds and other animals. Nobody feels liable because of such negligence and the waste remains on the street. To manage in points 3 and 4, I propose that the city government provides an information sheet to each resident (such as Uw with the magazine: “Leuven experience it”) what may or may not and when garbage bags can be put out, and which involves a fine if the Regulations are not observed. To this we would like to make a small remark which concerns us all; Many of the people are willing to wait for minutes (sometimes in line) to buy something, but not a second to keep their packaging with them, but just throw it on the street. I regularly have to clean up small packaging material for my house to keep our street clean. In particular, children, not knowing what is yes or not, should be made aware of the theme of ""litter"". Our schools can teach something like this for several minutes a day. 5. Clean streets The streets of Leuven are maintained and beautiful, but why is this only valid for the streets Within the ring ??? A step outside grows and weeds grow along footpaths, around the trees, between the paving stones and the facade of the houses, and this is how it looks different and unkempt. example of some streets: Oude Mechelen road and the surrounding states. Do these areas belong to Leuven ?? If not why should one pay an “outer ring resident” tax to Leuven city ???? A few years ago I saw a team working to make the street “weed-free”. They burned the weeds but left the burned remains, and days later the street looked even uglier than before. Is there any control by external contractors over the execution of the contract? It could be better!! It is also possible that new residents are not aware of their obligations to the city and its neighbors and therefore neglect their “gardens”, causing heaps of weed seeds to fly around and pollute the surrounding area. !! Hand out a short, concise pamphlet with multiple languages !! E.g .: garbage bags may be taken out 10 hours before collection, and they must be completely ready! I hope that this long explanation of my thoughts does not bore you. Tibor Nagy,",Jeanne Heaney,5/28/2019,3,4,

The current M-museum in Leuven has an extensive collection of Old Art. In addition, there are also 500 works of Contemporary Art that largely consist of loans from Cera. But, strangely enough, this collection cannot be fully shown “for practical and programmatic reasons”! My example is the Provincial Museum of Modern Art (PMMK) in Ostend. This museum provides an overview of Belgian art from the early 20th century to the present. In the new Museum of Modern Art Leuven, particular attention should be paid to artists from the 20th and 21st centuries who have / had a bond with Leuven (incl. Province of Flemish Brabant).

Possibly supplemented with temporary exhibitions. In the summer months one could also exhibit sculptures on the water (following “Art on the water”, Zoete Waters in Oud-Heverlee). In this way, ""upcoming talent from our own soil"" would have a chance to show themselves to the outside world. It is also an additional tourist attraction, even outside the summer season.

d143452a-6e35-4011-bf49-69a82a2527db,Decrease CO2 & particulate matter via transport on natural gas - climate neutral towards Leuven,"In Leuven, only 2 petrol stations currently offer CNG (natural gas). As a rapidly emerging alternative fuel, it would be good to stimulate the expansion of the CNG network in Leuven through financial support to operators and / or information campaigns. In this way, the choice for this sustainable fuel can be made easier for the inhabitants. In addition to a reduction in the number of cars, a shift from the Leuven fleet to greener passenger cars and public transport can play an important role in the aim of the city of Leuven to become climate neutral. In addition to electric cars, natural gas vehicles are also a very important alternative. The federal, Flemish and Walloon authorities have already recognized this and promote CNG as a fuel by exempting registration and traffic taxes, subsidies and other measures. However, there is a classic chicken-and-egg situation with regard to the number of filling stations that CNG offers, and the number of vehicles running on CNG. Some relevant facts about CNG vehicles: * Environmentally friendly: 77% less particulate matter than diesel, 11% less CO2 emissions, 90% less nitrogen oxides (Thomas More / UGent study); Bio-CNG up to 100% CO2 neutral. * 30 to 40% cheaper than diesel & petrol in terms of consumption and maintenance; CNG is a worthy alternative to passenger cars, but also to buses and trucks; * Natural gas is transported via existing underground network, resulting in fewer trucks on the road; * Several large car manufacturers see greater potential in CNG than electric cars and are investing in this. In 2018, for the first time, more CNG cars than electric cars were purchased in Belgium (Knack & FOD Mobility). * Disadvantages: on the one hand, the purchase price is relatively high, but thanks to the Flemish subsidies, the additional cost is fully compensated. In addition, the limited number of filling stations is another important barrier in Belgium compared to neighboring countries, with an impact on sales. In particular in Wallonia (from 2019 Opel Astra CNG will no longer be offered in Belgium, for example). The network is not yet firmly anchored in Leuven either. In the latter aspect, the city of Leuven has the possibility and possibly the means to play a role as a sustainable and ambitious city, by encouraging the strengthening of the CNG network also near Leuven. This would allow many car owners who drive in, through or along Leuven to consider CNG when purchasing a new car, where it now means for many people that there is no petrol station available on the daily route. Leuven currently only has 2 petrol stations that effectively offer CNG. In addition, there are petrol stations that have obtained a permit, in some cases for many years, but without following it. It cannot be excluded that these have a discouraging effect on neighboring petrol stations due to a false sense of competition. Specifically, the proposal is for the city of Leuven to consider the following measures to reduce CO2 emissions in and around Leuven and to achieve more environmentally friendly transport: * Short term: Provide clear information to operators of filling stations about the technical and financial factors for the offer from CNG; * Short term: Financial compensation for operators for the conversion of service stations when expanded to CNG. This can strengthen the business case for potential operators; * Short term: follow up issued permits, stimulate implementation; * Medium term: consider CNG for new city services vehicles * Long term: consider CNG for public transport; * Medium term: Deploy this policy in promoting Leuven as a city with ambition to become climate neutral.",Eileen Bashirian,6/8/2019,3,0,"Mobility,Sustainable development"

I have collected dozens of them myself in recent years. Some are now useful for storing things in the house, others ended up with the garbage, but the bulk of it is in the basement or hall ready to take with you when needed. Unfortunately they are usually there when I really want to use them. I am at the counter and have forgotten to bring back bags. The one bag that I usually have with me turns out to be too small or is already filled with other things. My panniers are still hanging on my bicycle, which is parked just a little too far away. Recognizable? Presumably, numerous pockets pile up behind each front door that - despite their beautiful ""reusable"" label - remain largely unused. Popular tote bags, plastic bags from supermarkets, cool bags, super handy bags from a popular shoe store that I am not going to advertise, ... the list is endless. The hot water has already been invented -------------------------------- The concept STARTSOME was recently launched in Leuven (check: https : //startsome.eu/). Reusable coffee cups that you borrow in a coffee bar and bring back when it fits. The same concept can actually be applied even more easily for reusable bags. Let's start by placing ""pocket stations"" in every library, thrift store and interested retailer. This takes up little space and can even replace existing packaging solutions. In combination with a smart app, users can even be encouraged to return bags to places where a shortage is approaching. Circular and cooperative ------------------------ Of course it is not the intention to buy new bags for this, there are enough behind our front doors. Let us design a logo and apply it to existing bags. Make this system accessible to everyone by making membership free (or in exchange for some starting bags).

This forest is not only a pleasant place for butterflies, birds, bees and small mammals, but also for humans. Children learn about nature in the outdoor classroom and local residents meet in a pleasant and healthy place. ------------- Tiny Forest® ------------- Tiny Forest is a concept conceived by Indian engineer Shubhendu Sharma (Afforestt CEO). He relied on the forestry method of the Japanese tree expert Akira Miyawaki. Dr. Miyawaki developed a method in the 1970s to restore natural native forests. He created over 1,700 forests, 96.7% of which developed into a resilient ecosystem within ten years. Shubhendu Sharma was inspired by Miyawaki's approach and translated the method into an urban environment. -------- Effects -------- * A Tiny Forest stimulates biodiversity: the 200 m2 forest consists of many different types of trees. These trees again attract insects and birds. * The forest brings nature experience closer. The distance between man and nature is greater than ever. A Tiny Forest at your doorstep stimulates curiosity and gives people the opportunity to discover and learn about nature in their own living environment. * The construction of Tiny Forests increases water storage capacity, improves air quality and combats heat stress. * Finally, a forest has a positive effect on health: more nature nearby can reduce stress and stress-related complaints.",Alex Bahringer,6/9/2019,11,0,Nature and biodiversity
09733044-17d8-44b9-b54e-d0d3619fb8aa,"No swimming pool, but a fountain square","Despite this, the current plan to construct a swimming pool in the Vaartkom remains the protest of many Leuven residents. The new mayor even says that it will certainly come, regardless of what the Leuven citizen wants. Perhaps the city council should take into account the fact that extremely dry summers are likely to be a recurring problem. My idea is that a type of fountain square, such as you can find in Nice and Bordeaux, can offer a more original and ecological alternative. In the summer, the sprinklers can be turned on and refreshment can still be provided with a minimum of water consumption. In the spring, autumn and winter the square can be used for other purposes and less money and energy has to be spent on maintenance. Such a square would also be much nicer than a regular bath and would also give Leuven and the Vaartkom a different character. It would also provide an opportunity for young, creative talents to achieve an architectural tour de force. I know that the pool is the brainchild of the new mayor, but that does not mean that it should be there anyway, even if it is stated in the administrative agreement. Think differently, do something new, ecological and innovative, make sure you've really earned that Green leaf prize.",Dr. Millard Boehm,5/12/2019,26,5,"Streets and squares,Sustainable development"

But all those extra banners and billboards on the sidewalk often take up too much space and make the sidewalks too narrow. I am an avid supporter of the bicycle myself, but it is noticeable that many cyclists are allowed to show a bit more etiquette when parking their bicycles on the sidewalks. For some years every landlord had to provide a parking space for bicycles and there was clearly a difference from now. But the mentality is that everyone wants their bike right outside the door and walking a few meters or putting the bike in is just too much, especially at underground parking lots of the student residences.

If the toilets (paying ..) in the bicycle parking under the Somer square should serve as a calling card for the city, I still have many doubts. Nasty is an understatement. Why can't those paying toilets be kept clean by thorough maintenance (several times a day), such as in an airport or an average station. In fact, the toilets in the library (downstairs) are not so much better for every Leuven citizen. Who really knows Leuven knows that you have to enter the library and walk to the children's department or perhaps go to the Inno? It used to be that way. In fact, the toilets should even be free, I think. Although I understand that it might cost some in terms of maintenance. My 8-year-old son had gone to the Kinepolis cinema with a friend of his class, and on the way home he realized he needed to go to the bathroom. He then went to the toilet (containers) at the station. He had to pay 50 cents. Well, that doesn't seem fair to a child, does it? But he had a bit of pocket money so he paid it nicely.

Examples: intersection Col. Begaultlaan / Brandweg in Wilsele and now also Col. Begaultlaan with the new Vaartbruggen. And there are more such situations. This gives you the impossible situation that cyclists have to give priority to cars that can come from three directions before they can cross within a 270 ° angle of view! So give priority to turning traffic behind you, turning traffic ahead of you, and crossing traffic to your right. However, cyclists are not owls that can turn their heads. The human eye (let alone that of a child of about 12 years of age who cycles to high school) is physically only able to see in a field of view of maximum 140 ° - and certainly not 270 °. So you can never cross without having previously checked whether there is a car coming or turning from any direction you need to give right of way. A person simply cannot do this physically.

ecba5e6d-26d9-43f6-b0db-859e59dcdcf2,Garestalaan / Meugenslaan / LB Dewezlaan,"In our neighborhood there is a playground that is only for toddlers / very young children: there is a mini playhouse, a small climbing frame, a balance beam, a rack to hang on, and a small rotation (no idea what its name is) , and a petanque field (one of the many unused petanque fields in Leuven). This playground was built in the early years of the district, and since everyone then apparently had a swing in the garden, it was decided to only build a toddler / kindergarten playground. Very unfortunate, because older children / primary school children do not find what they are looking for here, while there is a lot of space. Meanwhile, many homes have also changed hands, and there is indeed a demand for more common toys. A playground is also a place for children to meet, and when we moved to this week three years ago, I also saw opportunities for our children to play with neighborhood children (as I did in my own childhood). It turns out that few children go to this playground, just because there are not enough toys. We ourselves also prefer to go for an afternoon of fun with the children aged 7 and 9 to the provincial domain (despite the large crowds ...) or, for example, the Michottepark (because of the trees (on warm days) and the long slide), or to the large playground in the Casablancawijk. Or Heldenland in Tienen. So my concrete suggestion is to provide larger, more challenging toys. To start with swings and a large slide, but also a large climbing frame, a type of swing (is something you often see in Sweden, see attachment, swing in inverted V-shape), or a robinson (such a thing to put on a hanging seat from one side to the other over a cable, starting from a platform). In addition, I also wanted to signal something else: although this is a preschool, some older teenagers (they are also entitled to outdoor activities) also sit in the evening to train their muscles. They do this on the one climbing device that is previously intended for small children to hang on it or hang it upside down. This is used as a pull-up device to exercise arm muscles. Wouldn't it be a better idea to provide those outdoor fitness equipment in a separate place? There is still room for this, and there is also more than enough space on the playground of the new residential area (Meikeverlaan etc.). That is also a playground where there are far too few fun playground equipment and where children are very tired of it. And that while there very many children live close together (more than at Park Bellevue ..) And there is still ongoing construction. So that playground should also be addressed. The toys are very basic, and there is a gigantic lawn that is now more or less useless: who needs such a gigantic lawn? Wouldn't a big climbing spider web, a big swing, a slide, ... not be much more fun for the neighborhood children?",Freddie Mosciski,6/3/2019,13,0,

Look at the idea of 'vertical forest' from Milan by Stefano Boeri The 18-storey residential tower from Milan with 131 apartments, for 480 sums up the following advantages: * It is a multiplication of the number of greenery and trees in a city (example Milan: per person, two trees have been planted, 40 shrubs; 8 shrubs, and there are about 30 animals (mainly birds)) * Plants absorb the particulate matter from traffic, produce oxygen, reduce CO2; creates humidity, cools the environment, is acoustically and thermally insulating * It is a demineralization of urban life: (next to green roofs, roof vegetables gardens) * reduces energy consumption of the homes * There are two residential towers that together represent an estimated value of 19,825 kg / year CO2 absorption * Equivalent of 2 hectares of forest On a few square meters of land, people can find an alternative to living on the countryside in a green residential tower. People with a small budget must also be able to live in a green environment, where they can easily and quickly get to work school and shops without their own transport. The residential tower model may be an expensive model, but I would certainly recommend more green on roofs and facades, and the city should certainly set an example with this.

d5debd7f-a5bd-4756-b007-f673f43b87ad,Tiense green boulevard,"I dream that the city council will invest in more livable residential areas around the busy traffic axes of Leuven. Because a lot of people from Leuven also live and work in these city neighborhoods, and many children go to school every day. Some ideas with a view to a more livable Tiensesteenweg: * Plant a beautiful tree gallery that ensures better air quality and less heat. The tree mirrors can be provided with recycled cork, which immediately gives this tree gallery a circular touch. At the moment there is room to plant trees in places 1) where the footpath widens at the beginning and end of a parking lane, 2) on the intermediate lanes that are not used for pre-sorting, 3) on the elevated bus stops, 4) for the Saint Francis Church. Provide a flower meadow or bed here and there. These can be maintained by the local residents. More green on the Steenweg, the Steenweg with its side streets will make a more pleasant and healthier residential area for the people of Leuven. Moreover, it will also give Tiensesteenweg the cachet it deserves. After all, you will find many architectural gems along the brick road, which are now lost in the traffic. * Make work of a Mobipunt (www.mobipunt.be (http://www.mobipunt.be/)) on the Tiensesteenweg (eg site where emergency Colruyt was provided?), But also in and around Leuven eg at station and industrial area to further realize the access between the busy points. In this way, travelers can make the most appropriate and sustainable transport choice to their destination. These points immediately serve as carpool parking in order to increase the occupancy rate per car when a car is selected (recent research by VITO showed that the average occupancy rate of passenger cars is only 1.33). * Invest in electric shared cargo bikes (https://cargoroo.nl/), the perfect sustainable means of transport for groceries, transporting children,…. Make a conscious choice for e-hubs outside the city, at major shopping points, and not just in the city center. In consultation with Colruyt, there may be an e-hub at the Colruyt itself (incidentally, one of the most visited Colruyts across Belgium. Knowing that 65% of the Flemish take the car to do their shopping, and these Colruyt visitors may all come from the Leuven region, an e-hub is the perfect location there). * Remove the filling station for the Colruyt. This does not belong in a residential environment (and it would also be a perfect location for a station with electric cargo bikes). Moreover, there are already at least 3 petrol stations a little further on the Tiensesteenweg (outside the living area). * Only allow freight transport to enter Leuven center via Koning Boudewijnlaan. The current road infrastructure (cycle paths too close) of the brick road is not designed for this heavy traffic. * Invest in safe and wider cycle paths (and footpaths). The current cycle paths are not provided for the large amount of bicycles (mishmash of 'normal' bicycles, cyclists with child seats, older child tandems, e-bikes, speed pedelecs, and also the wide cargo bicycles and bicycles with bicycle trailer). This in combination with cars that are sometimes parked on the bicycle path, suppliers who do not find a parking space and then temporarily station on the bicycle path, the wide freight transport and buses, creates dangerous situations. * Also provide safe crossings eg crossing Tiensesteenweg towards Platte-Lostraat, and a wider crossing at De Ark (near the church), but I suspect that this will be included in the current works on the Steenweg. * The intermediate strip cannot be used for pre-sorting in some places. The strip would now become a bus lane from Koningin Elisabethlaan, but also remember whether the 3rd strip in the stretch from Tiensepoort to Elisabethlaan is needed, or can be used in some places to create more space for cyclists. * Provide some safe loading and unloading places for suppliers to the traders (during the working week most of the parked cars on the paved road are gone). I hope that the city council dares to think about taking the brick road (after the current works) to 'the next level'. This proposal is in line with several policy priorities from the administrative memorandum: accessible, accessible and traffic-safe city /// safe city with attractive residential areas /// sustainable, climate-neutral and circular city /// healthy and sporty city.

Like so many people from Leuven, I am still waiting for the small shuttle buses, which bring shoppers and tourists, frequently and for free, from the peripheral car parks to the city center. A nice idea to help people walking, for example from the parking tower on the Engels Plein, are the COPPER PLATES ON THE GROUND, as you will find them in almost every city, such as Hasselt, Tongeren, Poperinge ,, ... They are a nice guide and make you forget the walking distance, which is so complained about. They are also an added value for the tourist aspect of Leuven. Certainly a motivation not to create an extra parking space, instead of the Bruulparking! In an original way, the peripheral car parks will receive more attention. In order to make Leuven more consciously caring, I, as a resident, request MORE TRANSPARENCY regarding the use of our hard-earned tax money, paid to the city. A survey regarding large, unnecessary projects is certainly not inappropriate. Which ordinary citizen has asked for the expensive fountain on the Hooverplein, the LED lights in the Naamsestraat, the new lighting on the Grote Markt, the megalomaniac stage hall, ...? Do these realizations and projects not contrast sharply with the poor condition of the streets in the city center? In order to make the city center greener permanently, I propose to plant the trees in the ground and not torture them in the concrete, beautifully tiled containers. These can certainly be used to brighten up the city even more with annuals, flowering shrubs, ... The image of the baker in the Diestsestraat has been empty for some time after a dead tree has stood there for 2 years. To make the city cleaner, I think of cheaper brown bags and small blue bags. Perhaps an aid in combating illegal dumping. For that reason, I suspect, almost all bins in our neighborhood have disappeared, and I understand that.

Strategic placement of convex (convex) traffic mirrors can help to give road users an overview, so that they can give way. Some examples of places where such a traffic mirror can offer added value for road safety are: * Borstelsstraat on Gemeentestraat: the latter is a priority road. Coming from the first you cannot see behind the shark teeth what is coming from the left. * Leopold Ruelensstraat at Gemeentestraat. From the first you cannot see what is coming from the left or the right without entering the crosswalk. It is a narrow intersection and people do not always drive at an adjusted speed through the Gemeentestraat. * Liemingenstraat at Holsbeeksesteenweg. Behind the white stop line you cannot see which traffic is coming from the right. Due to the parking behavior in the latter, traffic coming from the south side (right side compared to Liemingenstraat) often drives on the left side of the road.",Gregory Gislason,5/1/2019,37,1,"Streets and squares,Mobility"

To listen to them you need a smartphone (or a tablet or laptop), a 3G connection and possibly headphones.

From that point, there is a designated cycle path on the Steenweg. Now you can only go in 1 direction through the Dreefstraat.

Solution to the problems: After the design of Glasblazerijstraat and its surroundings into a residential area, persistent problems continue to arise that negatively affect the quality of life in our pleasant street. There is too much parking error and too little green space. The car perspective choice for 5 parking spaces in a small cul-de-sac such as Valkerijgang for which there is actually no place, needs to be revised. Especially because there is no support among the residents for these parking spaces. The chaos, noise, crowds and abuse of the parking spaces that we experience time and again can only be resolved when our street becomes a car-free zone. To realize my idea it is important that the responsible services pay attention to this situation. There are already extensive car parking options around the Vaartkom (various underground car parks and a parking building). Removing five parking spaces is therefore a small gesture, but a great satisfaction in connection with the green environment where children can safely go outside on the street and have the opportunity to play.",Staci Keebler,6/1/2019,26,0,"Mobility,Living"

Bicycle drums or a custom simple construction are possible solutions. Due to the topography of the street and the location of the houses on the steep slope, few local residents can park bicycles indoors. Bicycles, e-bikes and cargo bicycles must therefore be parked in the public domain, with the high risk of theft and blocking of the footpaths as a result (see photo). Bicycle users are even willing to pay a small fee for using a shared cycling infrastructure nearby. For more than 5 years, this question has not been answered: * Spatial Planning Department always spoke of a danger of cluttering the public domain, but bicycle drums have now been seen in the Sint Maartensdal (see photo) * The Mobility Service finds the idea interesting , but sets other priorities and has too few staff * 'Stand up for your neighborhood' judges that the project is inadmissible because the social dimension is lacking * Roads and Traffic Service only listens to car users and acts little forward-looking. In the recent (2018-2019) redesign of the street, little or no account was taken of the above question from the cyclists (a few 'staples' were placed without consultation with the residents about its location). On the contrary, the requirements of the car users (supported by the local press) were met. The existing semi-private / public parking at Hogestraat has been completely renovated (see photo). Car users (local residents, but also visitors and long-term parkers (including students) can park for free (blue disc or parking card are not required).

There are countless studies that show that private cars are more stationary than driving and that they take up space that you cannot use for bicycle paths, squares, wide footpaths, etc. For these users, car sharing is a nice alternative and Cambio is finding its way with more and more Leuven people which is fantastic. But the conditions of this system are not accessible to everyone. It is understandable that a subscription / per hour / per km must be paid, but many systems also require a pre-financing / financial deposit and for the elderly and the socially weak it is often not possible to advance those several hundred euros and they drop out the boat. I therefore propose that the city take on this financing for a first car via a kind of third payer system. After all, it is usually a contribution that you get back if you would step out of the system again. So net this costs nothing to the city. It would convince a lot of people with an old and / or polluting car to give up and also people who only occasionally need a second car, decide to look for car-sharing systems.

The difficulties for them in the labor market are known. (This also applies to men, by the way.) See link: https://www.minderhedenforum.be/actua/detail/posieve-actie-arbeidsmarkt-nieuwe-europese-vermijden We were tapped on this, as a country .. But what can we do as a city? This is an incredible waste of talent. I do not know the figures, but I feel this is often about women who come along with their partner in the context of a study (at the KU. Leuven), or about women who end up here with a scholarship program, but not afterwards can get started because of all kinds of discrimination on the labor market. Maybe it's just about the lack of connections or knowledge about the possibilities on the Flemish (quite complicated labor market, just think of an IBO program, for example. Not everyone has ever heard of this). The result remains that this group often leaves after several years of disillusionment. We leave something big here as a city. Offer this group opportunities and possibilities through a network program (which also includes local international companies such as IMEC, Materialize, KU Leuven, etc ..) and at the same time work with an actual job mentor per candidate (VDAB does NOT ENOUGH in this area and also focuses only to those entitled to benefits, while a large proportion of the immigrants are not entitled to that benefit) and this approach will pay off. We want a city with international allure: that means being able to attract people from different backgrounds, but it also means: being able to keep it! Leuven, a mini Canada? I am thinking specifically of women here, because women are so good at self-effacing themselves in function of their partner or children, but at the same time they are often also the engine of the family and are often largely only responsible for the education of the children: Children who go to school here and grow up in our society. It is a cliché, but a good carer only really becomes good for someone else, if he or she takes good care of himself and is happy. And so the link has been made with the importance of a challenging job with value for a group of people who are responsible every day for the education of the next generation of young people who will grow up here and will be part of our wonderfully diverse city.",Ted Casper,6/7/2019,7,0,"economy,Social inclusion"

Example: the marked cycle path when approaching the traffic lights on the Geldenaaksebaan near Pakenstraat. In red, motorists are often partly on the bicycle path.

A cargo bike can replace a (second) family car for many residents. For residents of terraced houses, however, the lack of parking space for such a cargo bike is often an obstacle at the moment to switch from a (second) car to a cargo bike. They have no driveway, no garage, no place on the footpath, bicycle racks in the street are too small / narrow and there is no space in the hall of the house. That is why I propose, by analogy with the existing bicycle racks in the street, to divide parking spaces specifically for cargo bicycles. A parking space for one car can easily be rearranged into a parking space for 4 to 5 cargo bicycles with low brackets for a bicycle lock (cfr photo).

98a2dbe0-35ae-49ae-a73e-dae875910201,Operation Steel Ros,"Tackling road safety in the first part of Riddersstraat. More specifically, the conflict of interest between motorists, cyclists and pedestrians. Problem: Riddersstraat is narrow, but at the same time a popular entrance and exit to highways. At the same time it is a bicycle street, where cyclists can ride in both directions. This often means that as a motorist you have to close the door for the cyclists behind you or in front of you. Very dangerous. This often leads to frustration and also to traffic aggression. It also ensures that cyclists will ride on the sidewalk, of course without moderating their speed. My girlfriend is in a wheelchair with very limited mobility, before she can get out of the corner, the cyclist is already knocking her over. Not an exceptional incident. It is enough to get out for an hour to experience this problem firsthand. In my opinion, the situation is now also simply contradictory to the purpose of the circulation plan: there is no reason to drive a little to the right in a residential street. For this there are the ring and the approach roads, both of which can be reached simply, easily and very efficiently along each side of that part of Riddersstraat. That infrastructure is already in place. By placing poles in the middle and creating an artificially dead-end street, motorists are forced to change their behavior and drive in and out via the Leuven ring road. The solution is therefore very cheap and can be realized with a minimum of personnel. It would also greatly improve air quality, because the curious nose result was the worst in all of Leuven here.

They drive in the wrong direction (which you don't expect as a car driver or cyclist since it is one way) and often at too high a speed. Originally, at the beginning of the district there was a sign with 30 km / h and a sign to indicate the chance of children playing. These have been removed. There is another sign on the drive out of the neighborhood that indicates the end of 30 km / h, but is no longer visible (paint has faded). In the meantime, many young families with young school-aged children live in this district and are motivated by the school to cycle more. Trucks coming from a street where no cars or trucks should be allowed to leave is an unpleasant surprise for young cyclists.

The sidewalk is only 2 tiles wide in some places, there you barely have enough space to pass with a buggy or bicycle. The road itself is not wide enough to allow a brave cyclist to climb safely. A climbing cyclist needs more space if he has to pedal vigorously, his bike swings left and right to the rhythm of pedaling. In the Ardennes and in France, on similar slopes, there are road signs that prescribe a distance of 1.5 m to motorists passing a bicycle! There is not enough space on the Keizersberg. Therefore, one lane must be 'sacrificed', and therefore a single direction for motorized traffic. I would forbid the climbing direction of travel, because it emits too much fine dust. The Keizersberg is in fact a hollow road with steep walls, the fine dust lingers longer in such a canyon.

This means: just about every minute of the day, between 6 a.m. and 11 p.m., planes that take off loudly roaring over your head, making quiet reading a book in your garden a real visit. You can therefore say that we are very abundant in Wijgmaal, as far as noise is concerned. ""You learn to live with it"" really doesn't work if it keeps getting worse. The previous city council of Leuven turned out to be pro Leuven Straight on and certain ministers have also made a strong commitment to this.

Why? The traffic situation on the Holsbeeksesteenweg between the intersection with the Lieming and the provincial domain is very dangerous for cyclists and pedestrians. * The intersection with the Lieming itself is unclear. Due to the numerous (too far?) Parked cars in the Lieming, a head-on collision with a running car from the Holsbeeksesteenweg is almost certain in the long term. * Cars coming from the Lieming on the Holsbeeksesteenweg towards the provincial domain are confronted with frontal traffic on the Holsbeeksesteenweg. There are so many parked cars in the Holsbeeksesteenweg itself that an almost continuous stream of 'passing' traffic arrives. The existing parking bans and lines are hardly respected. * Cyclists attempting to pass by will be oppressed - the road is simply too narrow for the parked cars + passing cars + cyclists.

We increasingly need a diversity of profiles in the ICT sector. Young people from all disciplines drastically increase their chances on the labor market if they can supplement their domain-specific knowledge with IT skills such as programming. That is why I would like to establish a Coding University in Leuven. This will be a place where college and university students come together at regular intervals to learn how to program. This initiative will co-exist with current CoderDojos and will be more aimed at students and learning to program in common languages such as Java and .NET. In addition, this Coding University can also be the place where young people work on their own technological projects. In this way, the Leuven technology sector is boosted by the influx of new talent from home, students are given the opportunity to develop much sought-after skills for the labor market and young people are given a place and guidance to develop their own technological projects that can contribute to for example smart cities. In order to limit the cost of this, students of computer science and computer science can be deployed as lecturers and together with the Leuven technology companies, it can be examined which specific knowledge should be taught. In this way, Leuven forms the bridge between the great demand for IT professionals with specific business knowledge and the many students who find their way to the city every year.",Cari Frami,6/8/2019,6,0,"Education and youth,Technology"

The question is whether this should all be done within the Leuven borders. Together with surrounding municipalities or even regions, a high-performance regionet can possibly do much more and much better. That is why it is desirable to take a break or a significant delay to manage possible developments on the basis of a survey (such as Leuven 2000).

In all administrative bodies and councils, seniors (+55) belong equally. Operation of the seniors council 2. The city council should automatically and timely consult the seniors council whenever a policy measure is being made that concerns the seniors. This is not currently happening in Leuven. 3. Exchange of information between the different advisory councils is important. The city council should encourage the mutual representation of and in the various advisory councils. There are currently NO representatives of the Leuven senior council on the Leuven advisory councils. 4. We insist that the city's policy plans are submitted to the Seniors Council in good time, when they are still in the initial phase. Mobility 5. Existing pedestrian crossings can be improved by lighting them sufficiently in the evening and in winter and by adapting the traffic lights so that less mobile seniors have enough time to cross. Well-being and housing 6. Most seniors want to live in their own familiar environment (own home) for as long as possible. 7. Sufficient (more) couches and public toilets must be provided on walking routes. More and free pee points in the city would not be out of place. 8.

6cda4317-19c6-4707-bb47-060663ecdca7,Fly-over for cyclists on Brugbergpad - Kessel-Lo,"At the intersection Diestsepoort - Vuurkruisenlaan, the bicycle highways F24 and F25 also cross. In addition, the main access for Inbev trucks, the entrance to the depot of De Lijn and the delivery location for VAC are located at this intersection. A busy and complicated intersection, with a careless control of the traffic lights. Large hordes of high school students flock to this crossroads via the Brugbergpad (very beautifully and functionally redesigned!). In the morning between a quarter to eight and a quarter to eight, all possible places are full of cyclists waiting for one of the many lights. The intersection is a low point in the area: the road descends from both the Diestsepoort and the Brugbergpad. -------------------------------------------------- --------------- We propose to make the most of the topography of the site and to build a star-shaped flyover for cyclists at this intersection, covering the three branches of bicycle highways at Diestsepoort, Vuurkruisenlaan and the Brugbergpad. All motorized traffic on the Vuurkruisenlaan and on the entrances to the Lijn and Inbev passes under the fly-over, and can therefore run much more streamlined. The flow on Diestsesteenweg improves as a result. -------------------------------------------------- --------------- It will be a technical challenge to keep all gently sloping bicycle surfaces as low as possible to allow comfortable cycling, but also high enough not to obstruct the passing traffic. Specifically, the fly-over will typically start a hundred meters before the intersection. This is relatively easy on Diestsepoort and Vuurkruisenlaan. The Brugbergpad will have to start climbing before it dives under the railway bridge. -------------------------------------------------- --------------- The design is also a challenge. The Antwerp park bridge (https://www.antwerpen.be/nl/info/56544ab3b2a8a7c3998b45f2/parkbrug) and the cykelslangen københavn (https://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/bicycle-snake-gdk1087414) can serve as a source of inspiration. -------------------------------------------------- --------------- To further strengthen the bicycle traffic to this flyover from the direction of Vlierbeek Abbey, I propose to convert Achturenstraat and Albrecht Rodenbachstraat into bicycle streets (which is a relief means for the parallel Gemeentestraat and a safer road for these cyclists from the Ruelensstraat).

The project brings various local residents together to exercise more during 12 weeks. During the 2nd edition (2018-2019), 42 participants from two Leuven neighborhoods (Ridderbuurt and Sint-Maartensdal) took up the challenge. 15 physical education / movement recreation students also enthusiastically stepped in to assist them in this. The 12 weeks started with a first introductory moment and a fitness measurement. Each participant was linked to one or more exercise partners and equipped with a Fitbit (sports watch), with which they could register their movement. In addition, each duo / group of participants was guided by a student coach and encouraged by the community workers. Every week a movement moment was planned per duo / group and occasionally there was also an appointment with the entire group. The aim was to become a fit and warm neighborhood in Leuven. During this project, local residents with a diverse social background were given the opportunity to meet and stimulate each other in moving together. Together with the local residents, the student coaches looked for a tailored exercise offer. It was important to believe in everyone's strengths and talents, also to adjust everyday habits, regardless of social background. And even if the adjustments are only very small, they can still have a major impact in the long term. Hopefully this meaningful project will receive further financial support from the city of Leuven. Since Moving Neighbors is embedded in the neighborhood activities and in an optional internship for the second-year students of physical education / movement recreation at UC Leuven, we can continue working towards fit and warm (new) neighborhoods. Moving Neighbors will certainly make a valuable contribution to various ambitions of groundbreaking Leuven.

My inspiring example of this participation project is: ""Cantania in BOZAR"" for Brussels schools. https://www.bozar.be/nl/news/141599-cantania-oproep-voor-het-schooljaar-18-19 The strength of Leuven is that there is a lot of expertise in house. There is a city soprano, there are numerous singing educators, there is the SLAC singing class, there are music pedagogy, singing, composition and choral conducting courses at the Lemmens Institute. Many expert singing educators conduct their children's choir or youth choir with great enthusiasm every week. Only children of parents who can bring their child to and from a rehearsal every week enjoy high-quality singing rehearsals. By planning a weekly choir rehearsal during class hours or as an afternoon activity at school, every child in Leuven gets the chance to discover his or her singing voice. Singing is equivalent to exercising. Singing stimulates the brain and helps improve learning performance. Singing promotes social emotional well-being of children, which reduces bullying behavior. Singing is super nice and creates an atmosphere of togetherness. In addition to your child who comes home from school singing, this idea will also yield a lot of benefits in the long term in social cohesion of the Leuven population. Teachers receive full training of professional experts by participating weekly. They can build their further careers on these weekly singing experiences. The repertoire can be built up with Western choir classics supplemented with a song repertoire of foreign-language newcomers and new compositions by students from the Lemmens Institute. The project can grow across sectors to collaborations with culture and health care. Performances can be scheduled in nursing homes, hospitals. Research in social interaction and learning performance can be linked to this from KUL.

I find this strange because the city wants fewer cars. My proposal is therefore to adapt this to the current time. Possible alternatives: for a very small residential unit such as a studio, for example, you only need to provide a large bicycle shed and no parking space. For a mediocre apartment, 1 place per 2 apartments is sufficient. For a large apartment or terraced house, 1 parking space is sufficient. An extra plus could be if there is a charging station or a spacious parking space for a shared car. The fewer car places are provided, the greater the car consumption will automatically decrease and the use of the bicycle or alternatives will increase.",Stacy Rolfson,5/27/2019,14,5,

8288c66b-efc1-4349-9038-15bf368075a1,Reporting point bicycle safety / bicycle friendly,"Leuven profiles itself as a 'bicycle-friendly' city. However, besides the known bottlenecks, eg Geldenaaksebaan, there are also several other places where bicycle safety / bicycle friendliness is lacking. This often has to do with the position of the other road users in relation to the cyclists, but it is also about pits in the road and the like. For example, I refer to the Hertogstraat (section between Naamsesteenweg and Waversebaan) in Heverlee, where as a cyclist riding in the direction of Naamsesteenweg, you are almost always driven into the side by motorists who refuse to respect the priority rules. This requires a structural solution. Noticeable improvements could also be achieved through simple and inexpensive measures. As an example I give the bicycle crossings at the intersection of the Tervuursevest. There you always have to cycle through terribly deep gutters that form an attack on your bicycle. This can be solved easily and cheaply by placing steel ramps over the gutters. I therefore propose to create a 'reporting point' where such matters can be registered so that the city authorities are aware of these dangers and that a solution is effectively sought.",Shirley Block,5/8/2019,20,0,Mobility
f6984124-5302-4494-9b1d-980e14625678,Connecting children and the elderly through stories and questions,"""That's how it was then ..."" Sometimes, in a flash, you notice a mutual interest: small children sometimes want to chat with that very old lady or man from the neighborhood, and vice versa. ""Madame Pauline said this, and laughed ..."", ""Mister Constant told that and thought deeply ..."" But there is no time, because the children have to go to their 'activity'. And we, parents, must then quickly dismiss that mutual interest. Why not take it slower and start something? We can invite older people in a structured way to tell a (really happened) story to a small group of children during the weekend in their house. About the past, about what the neighborhood looked like at the time, about events large and small, about something you never believe ... Preferably based on some photos or an object. An adult accompanies. Advantages: * the elderly get a bit out of their social isolation (I am not talking about the pressured ""grandparents"" from the baby boom generation, but about the generation just before - although, we do not exclude anyone) * children have to learn to listen have some respect for those old people, and see a very different environment (imagine the salon of an old lady, or the attic of an old gentleman); that's different from the sometimes hyperactive activity environment we often chase them to over the weekend. Here less stimuli and a slower pace. * children may acquire a bit more depth perception, and why not, already a kind of historical awareness; a different voice, old photos, bizarre wallpaper, a different way of speaking, the slow ... well, pedagogically that is probably justifiable Requirements: * 5 plastic chairs for 5 children (or something), which we bring by appointment, so that they can be seated around the storyteller * 5 children (or something), target group 4 to 7 years (with a few tests of this idea, this group seemed very fascinated and open to it) * a few volunteer caregivers who can agree with the older person beforehand discuss and check how best to proceed (are there nice pictures or objects with which you build a story?) * a kind of script with tips & tricks for a successful moment, so that the storyteller does not lose the thread, and the children can also ask questions * a facebook or other page to share appointments * storytellers can receive another group every few weekends It's just an (old) idea!",Hanna Marvin,5/6/2019,14,0,"Education and youth,Social inclusion"
